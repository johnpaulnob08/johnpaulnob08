# Hi, I'm Pau!👋

I’m an Information Technology student at Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan, passionate about tech, leadership, and creativity. My journey blends technical learning with community involvement — exploring programming, building systems, and leading initiatives as the President of the IT Student Body (XCITeS). I love sharing knowledge, organizing events, and inspiring fellow students to grow in both skill and spirit.
